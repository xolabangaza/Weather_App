* Setup Instructions

 Follow these steps to run the project locally:

* Clone the repository

* git clone <repo-url>
* cd <project-folder>


* Install dependencies

* npm install


Environment variables

The .env file at the project root includes the OpenWeatherMap API key for demo purposes:

REACT_APP_WEATHER_API_KEY=your_actual_openweathermap_api_key


No additional setup is required ‚Äî the project is plug-and-play for demonstration.

Start the application

npm start


The app will open at http://localhost:3000 in your default browser.

Usage

Search for a city: Use the search box on the right panel. Select from the dropdown to see weather data.

Click on the map: Click anywhere to fetch weather for that location.

Dark mode toggle: The map and side panel adjust automatically if dark mode is enabled.

Weather details: View temperature, condition, humidity, wind speed, and weather icon.

Notes

This project is for demo purposes only.

The API key is included so anyone can run the app immediately.

For production or public repos, never commit API keys. Use environment variables or backend proxies for security.

Geolocation requires browser permission. If denied, the map defaults to a global view, and you can search for cities instead.
